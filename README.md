# Python-Code-to-detect-email-spying-chrome-extension
Just give the url of the folder which contains chrome extension and this code will tell you whether extension is doing email spying or not.
Code is written in python in Python 3.
My code has a lot of comments and it is self explainatory.
If any problem you can contact me at akshaygoeltheboss@gmail.com
Thank You
